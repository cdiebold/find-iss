# Why React not one of the other frontend frameworks
I am starting a new job in a few weeks and do not have any public projects that I can show. Also, I am not as familiar with react as I am with Vue. So this project allows me to practice some react before jumping on a team working alongside seasoned frontend developers and start creating a public web development portfolio. It is also fun.
